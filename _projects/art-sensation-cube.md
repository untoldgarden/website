# Art/Sensation Cube

Cube is a virtual exhibition space that challenged conventional notions of how we can show art in a 3D environment, promoting interaction with the environment in order to discover the work. Sound elements are placed in different parts of the room and are activated by the visitor’s movements in the exhibition, while the light dramatizes the mood of the work. Visitors can discover more via links and create direct contact with the artists on social media or private messages. Cube is developed by Art/Sensation and Untold Garden.
