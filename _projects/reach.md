description: Reach is an artwork that combines hand clay sculpting, traditional bronze casting, electronics, and spatial computing. The project consists of three bronze sculptures connected through a virtual layer in augmented reality (AR) experienced with Apple Vision Pro. When you touch one sculpture, your body heat is transmitted to the others, seen in AR, and felt through vibrations deep inside. Premiered at Saatchi Gallery, British Art Fair

# Reach

*You cannot hear each other, you cannot see each other, <br>
you can only feel each other's warmth.*

Reach combines hand clay sculpting, traditional bronze casting, electronics, and spatial computing. The project consists of three bronze sculptures connected through a virtual layer in augmented reality (AR). When you touch one sculpture, your touch is transmitted to the others, seen in AR, and felt through vibrations deep inside.

​With your hand across its surface, you communicate in silence, in secret. A virtual layer allows you to see these silent words of warmth flowing from the hands of those who feel its distant parts. Reach merges ancient craft with cutting-edge technology to form a collective experience based on our most intimate byproduct: body heat.

>One installation that stood out to me was an AR experience where viewers used an Apple Vision headset to reveal how heat moves when they touch the sculpture. This type of art redefines the boundaries between the artist and the viewer, making the audience an integral part of the creative process.

>Bronze sculptures that help you feel another’s presence through the warmth of your hand, visualised through AR but felt through your heart. If Rothko was alive now this is how he might communicate his feelings. You touch together irrespective of location and see the colours warm through yellows orange and red pulsating with love.

In Reach, your touch is expanded into a virtual tactile language, a somatic poetry, where the interspatiality of the individual sculptures allows them to maintain their connection across vast distances, connecting your touch to the touch of others regardless of where you are. 

The heat flow that this interconnectedness enables can be viewed through an augmented reality layer in Apple Vision Pro. This turns Reach into an intimate social network accessible only to those who can touch its physical manifestation, communicating solely through the medium of their own body heat.

## Conceptual Background

*Time is the internal form of space; just as space is the external form of time.*  
—Novalis.

In quantum mechanics, time is a property as contextual and malleable as space. Carlo Rovelli, the famous physicist, states that "in the elementary equations of the world, the arrow of time appears only where there is heat. The link between time and heat is therefore fundamental: every time a difference is manifested between the past and the future, heat is involved." It then follows that just as time is the internal form of space, heat is the internal form of time.

In her short story 'The Author of the Acacia Seeds,' Ursula K. Le Guin speculates on a language entirely based on touch, "[they] cannot hear each other; they cannot see each other. They can only feel the other's warmth. That is their poetry, that is their art." Touch is heat. Touch is communication. In Reach, touch is expanded into a virtual tactile language, somatic poetry, where your touch is connected to the touch of others, regardless of where in the world you are.

The interspatiality of the individual sculptures allows them to maintain their connection across vast distances. The heat flow that this interconnectedness enables can be viewed through an augmented reality layer on Meadow (the social platform for exhibiting immersive content) for Apple Vision OS. Meadow turns Reach into an intimate social network accessible only to those who can touch its physical manifestation, communicating solely through the medium of their own body heat.
